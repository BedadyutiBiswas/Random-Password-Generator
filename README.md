# Random-Password-Generator
## Project Objective:
(a)Project Name: Random Password Generator
(b)Objective: To create a Java Swing-based application that generates random and secure passwords.
(c)Features: Generates passwords with a combination of:
             1)Uppercase letters
             2)Lowercase letters
             3)Digits (numbers)
             4)Special characters (e.g., symbols like !, @, #, etc.)
Allows users to specify the desired password length.
Provides options to select the strength of the password (e.g., weak, moderate, strong).
## Implementation Details:
(a)Language: Java
(b)GUI Framework: Java Swing
(c)Libraries/Modules: You can use Java’s built-in libraries for random number generation and character manipulation.
Alternatively, consider using third-party libraries like Passay or Apache Commons Text for more advanced password generation rules.
## Example Usage:
1)User specifies a password length of 12 characters and selects “strong” strength.
2)The application generates a password like: R#9kLp$7!Tq2.
## Considerations:
1)Ensure that the generated passwords are cryptographically secure.
2)Handle any edge cases (e.g., minimum password length, character restrictions).
Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface using Java Swing components (buttons, labels, text fields, etc.).
## Next Steps:
1)Implement the password generation logic in Java.
2)Create the GUI layout with appropriate components.
